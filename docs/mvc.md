# The Model View Controller (MVC)

## Models
Models are a database wrapper. Models allow you to interact with your database.

## Views
Views are the response body contents that get displayed to the browser/client
- HTML
- CSV
- PDF
- XML
- etc...

## Controllers
Controllers decide how to process a request and define a response. Controllers often take requests and converts them into commands for the Models or Views.

## Routes
Matchers for the URL that is requested

- Example: The HTTP request "GET /about" requests the "/about" route
